# advent-2020

This is a stubborn attempt to participate in the [Advent of Code
2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) using "pure" R7RS-large in Guile.  The
catch is that Guile doesn't support R7RS-large, so I need to cobble it together
from the relevant SRFI reference implementations.

Solving 50 problems in 25 days over the holiday period is a tall order, so I
don't realistically expect to have everything completed in time.  My main
objectives are to get comfortable with some of the R7RS-large libraries,
identify gaps in Guile's R7RS-large support, and perhaps find something to
contribute to improve that situation.
